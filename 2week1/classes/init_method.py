#All classes have a built-in method called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
#Create a class named Person, use the __init__() method to assign values for name and age:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Emil", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

#Without the __init__() method, you would need to set properties manually for each object:
class Person:
  pass

p1 = Person()
p1.name = "Tobias"
p1.age = 25

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

#Using __init__() makes it easier to create objects with initial values
